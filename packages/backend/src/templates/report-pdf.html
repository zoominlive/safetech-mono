            <p>Safetech Environmental Limited (Safetech) was commissioned by <strong>{{clientName}}</strong> to conduct a designated substances and hazardous materials assessment within <strong>Project Area Placeholder</strong> of <strong>Building Name Placeholder</strong> located at <strong>{{projectLocation}}</strong>. The objective of the assessment was to determine the presence, location, condition and quantities of designated substances and other hazardous materials in the project areas that have the potential to be disturbed as part of planned <strong>{{projectName}}</strong> so that appropriate control measures can be implemented to protect workers during the work.</p>
            <p>This assessment satisfies the Owner's requirements under Section 30 of the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA), Revised Statutes of Ontario 1990, as amended. Section 30(1) requires a building owner to determine if there are any designated substances present at a project site prior to construction or demolition activities. Sections 30(2), (3) and (4) require the Owner and constructors for a project to provide the findings in this report as part of the tendering information for any tendered project or to prospective contractors (and subcontractors) of a project before entering into a binding contract.</p>
            <p>This report documents findings of our on-site inspection that was conducted on <strong>{{assessmentDate}}</strong> and provides conclusions and recommendations based on our findings and knowledge of the planned <strong>{{projectName}}</strong> project.</p>

However, given that no destructive testing was conducted, there is a remote possibility that UFFI could be hidden within locations such as exterior wall cavities. If suspect foam insulation is identified during renovation/demolition activities work should be stopped and the area should be re-assessed to evaluate conditions and determine appropriate control measures and worker protection, if necessary.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 16px;">Texture Coat/ Plaster identified to be asbestos-containing is recommended to be treated as friable ACM since disturbance of this material typically results in significant degradation and subsequent dust/debris generation that cannot be adequately controlled through wetting. Therefore, removal or disturbance of 1 square metre or less of texture coat should be conducted following Type 2 operations. If more than 1 square metre of texture coat is to be removed or disturbed then work should be conducted following Type 3 operations.</p>

If more than 1.0 m2 of friable ACM is to be removed or disturbed, then work should be conducted following Type 3 operations.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 16px;">Given the presence of asbestos-containing sprayed fireproofing, it is cautioned that this material or related debris may be concealed on the surface of false ceilings. As such, access above a false ceiling where asbestos-containing sprayed fireproofing is present is classified as a Type 2 operation (full enclosure method for access).</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 16px;">Similarly, asbestos-containing sprayed fireproofing debris may be present within wall cavities. Therefore, access within these spaces is recommended to be conducted following Type 2 operations as a precautionary measure.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 16px;">As required by O.Reg. 278/05, cleaning or removal of ventilation components including rigid ducting (excluding filters) in the buildings with asbestos-containing sprayed fireproofing must be conducted following Type 3 procedures. For buildings where asbestos-containing sprayed fireproofing has been identified, replacement of filters within the ventilation system (air handling units and fan coils) must be conducted as a Type 2 operation as per the requirements of O.Reg. 278/05.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 16px;">The removal or disturbance of ACM must follow the measures and procedures indicated in O. Reg. 278/05. This work should be conducted by workers who have received proper training by a "competent person" in the hazards of asbestos exposure, personal hygiene and work practices, and the use and care of respirators and protective clothing. Any worker/supervisor who works in a Type 3 operation must successfully complete the Asbestos Abatement Worker or Supervisor Training Program approved by the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development. It is recommended that all work involving the removal or disturbance of ACM be subject to inspection and testing to document conformance with O. Reg. 278/05 requirements. The degree of inspection and testing is dependent on site-specific conditions such as the type, duration, size and location of the work. In most circumstances Type 3 operations require a visual inspection and clearance air testing to be conducted by a competent worker on completion of the work. The inspection should be conducted to ensure that the enclosure and the work area inside the enclosure are free from visible dust, debris or residue that may contain asbestos. Clearance air testing for Type 3 operations requires a minimum number of air samples to be taken (depending on the size of the work area) following specific sampling and analytical procedures and all samples taken must meet the clearance criteria set out in O. Reg. 278/05.</p>

The purpose of the PCB Regulations is to improve the protection of Canada's environment and the health of Canadians by minimizing the risks posed by the use, storage and release of PCBs by accelerating the elimination of these substances.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 32px;">As of December 31, 2009 all current PCB storage sites are to have been eliminated and there should no longer be any electrical capacitors, electrical transformers, electromagnets, heat transfer equipment or any other equipment in service that contains PCBs at a concentration greater than 500 mg/kg (500 ppm). As of this time, all of this equipment should have been removed from service and sent for destruction. Furthermore, the PCB Regulations restricts the use of equipment containing PCBs (other than light ballasts or pole-top electrical transformers) at concentrations exceeding 50 mg/kg (50 ppm) in sensitive areas (such as drinking water treatment plants, schools, hospitals and senior citizen care facilities) by the same date. All other locations have until December 31, 2025 to decommission equipment containing 50 ppm to 500 ppm PCBs.

However, it should be cautioned that since only the lamps were retrofitted (and not the entire light fixture) there is a potential for previous ballasts used with T12 lamps (which may contain PCBs) to be left in place; although this was not identified within the one fixture with T8 lamps that was inspected. Therefore, should renovation/demolition work result in removal and disposal of existing fluorescent light fixtures containing T8 lamps it is still recommended that each fixture is individually assessed for the presence of PCB-containing ballasts and if discovered should be handled and disposed of accordingly as described above.</p>

As per R.R.O 1990, Regulation 347, General - Waste Management, the land disposal of PCB waste is prohibited. PCB wastes in Ontario are regulated under R.R.O 1990, Regulation 362, Waste Management – PCBs (Reg. 362), made under the Environmental Protection Act. Under this regulation, PCB waste is defined as any waste material containing PCBs at a concentration of more than fifty (50) parts per million by weight (i.e. >50mg/kg), with the exception of an electrical capacitor that has never contained over 1 kg of PCB's. Any PCB-containing equipment taken out of service should be properly handled and disposed of at an authorized destruction facility in accordance with the requirements of Federal Regulation SOR/2008-273 and Reg. 362.</p>

Additionally, it was confirmed that all original T12 fluorescent lights (including the ballasts and complete fixtures) have been replaced with T8 fluorescent lights in the project areas and, therefore, this lighting should not have PCB-containing ballasts. Or, If the building is known to be constructed after 1980, no light fixtures are expected to have PCB-containing ballasts as the manufacture of PCBs in the U.S. was banned in 1979 and Canada banned the import, manufacture and sale of PCBs in 1977. Similarly, no other electrical equipment (such as transformers and capacitors) present in the subject area(s) is expected to contain PCBs based on the age of building construction.</p>

            <p>The information and recommendations detailed in this report were carried out by trained professional and technical staff in accordance with generally accepted environmental and industrial hygiene work practices and procedures. Recommendations provided in this report have been generated in accordance with accepted industry guidelines and practices. These guidelines and practices are considered acceptable as of the date of this report.</p>
            <p>In preparation of this report, Safetech relied on information supplied by others, including without limitation, information pertaining to the history and operation of the site, test results and reports of other consultants and testing services provided by independent laboratories. Except as expressly set out in this report, Safetech has not made any independent verification of information provided by independent entities.</p>
            <p>The collection of samples at the location noted was consistent with the scope of work agreed-upon with the person or entity to whom this report is addressed and the information obtained concerning prior site investigations.  As conditions between samples may vary, the potential remains for the presence of unknown additional contaminants for which there were no known indicators.</p>
            <p>The analytical method used for determination of asbestos content meets the requirements of O. Reg. 278/05.  However, small asbestos fibres may be missed by PLM due to resolution limitations of the optical microscope. Interfering binder/matrix and/or low asbestos content may also hinder positive identification by PLM. These conditions are common for vermiculite attic insulation (VAI) and non-friable organically bound (NOB) materials such as vinyl floor tiles, roofing materials, mastics and caulking and can lead to "false negative" results. Due to limitations of the analytical method we cannot confirm that low quantities of asbestos are not present in these samples using solely PLM analysis. Additional analytical procedures should be considered for such materials to rule out false negative results.</p>
            <p>Conclusions are based on site conditions at the time of inspection and can only be extrapolated to an undefined limited area around inspected locations.  The extent of the limited area depends on building construction and conditions.  Building materials that are not detailed within this survey due to inaccessibility during the time of survey and/or are uncovered during renovation/demolition activities should be properly assessed by a qualified person prior to their disturbance.  Safetech cannot warrant against undiscovered environmental liabilities. If any information becomes available that differs from the findings in this report, we request that we be notified immediately to reassess the conclusions provided herein.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Designated Substances</strong> (as prescribed by Ontario Regulation 490/09): Acrylonitrile, Arsenic, Asbestos, Benzene, Coke Oven Emissions, Ethylene Oxide, Isocyanates, Lead, Mercury, Silica and Vinyl Chloride.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Hazardous Materials</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><em>Chemical Hazards</em></strong> – Urea Formaldehyde Foam Insulation (UFFI)</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Biological Hazards</em></strong> – Mould Contamination and Pest Infestation</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Environmental Hazards</em></strong> – Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Ozone Depleting &amp; Global Warming Substances</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Concealed locations such as above solid plaster or drywall ceilings, within plaster or drywall wall cavities, enclosed mechanical/pipe shafts and bulkheads, etc. were not investigated, unless otherwise stated in this report. Similarly, motors, blowers, electrical panels, etc., were not de-energized or disassembled to examine concealed conditions. Building materials that are not detailed within this assessment due to inaccessibility at the time of our site visit and/or uncovered during renovation/demolition activities should be assessed by a qualified person prior to their disturbance.</p>
        <p>Bulk sampling followed by laboratory analysis was also conducted to confirm the presence/absence of select hazardous materials. Bulk sampling was limited to asbestos in building materials and lead in paint on building finishes (if flaking paint was present). All other hazardous materials were identified by visual inspection only. Where possible, observations regarding the location, quantity and condition of the hazardous materials identified were made to determine the potential for exposure and provide appropriate recommendations for remedial action, if necessary. Specific methodology for each individual hazardous material assessed is further detailed below.</p>

        <h4>Designated Substances</h4>
        <h4><em>Asbestos</em></h4>
        <p>A visual inspection for the presence of both friable and non-friable asbestos-containing material (ACM) was performed in the subject area.</p>
        <p>If an existing asbestos survey was available for review, Safetech relied on the information present. Building materials that were visually similar to materials previously tested and that were confirmed to be either ACM or non-ACM were considered to have consistent content and were not re-sampled. Additional sampling was only conducted where the investigator believed a need existed.</p>
        <p>Bulk samples of building materials suspected to contain asbestos were retrieved by Safetech only for materials that were deemed to have a potential to be disturbed as part of the construction project. Some suspect materials may not have been sampled during our investigation. Bulk samples were retrieved in accordance with Section 3 and Table 1 of Ontario Regulation 278/05, <em>Designated Substance – Asbestos on Construction Projects and in Buildings and Repair Operations</em>. The number of samples collected for each material was based on the type and quantity of the material present in the subject area. Each individual sample was placed in a labeled zip-lock bag for transportation to an accredited independent laboratory.</p>
        <p>Analysis for asbestos content was performed by the independent laboratory in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Test Method <em>600/R-93/116: Method for the Determination of Asbestos in Bulk Building Materials</em> (June 1993). This method identifies the asbestos fibre content of building materials using polarized light microscopy (PLM) analytical techniques, with confirmation of presence and type of asbestos made by dispersion staining optical microscopy. This analytical method meets the requirements set forth in Section 3 of O. Reg. 278/05.</p>
        <p>In accordance with O. Reg. 278/05, an asbestos-containing material is defined as material that contains 0.5 per cent or more asbestos by dry weight. The laboratory was instructed to conduct “stop-positive” analysis for all materials. If a sample was found to be asbestos-containing, no further analysis was conducted for samples taken from the same homogeneous material.</p>
        <p>Locations where ACM have been identified are detailed in this report. Recommendations pertaining to ACM were made based on the friability, accessibility and condition of the material in conjunction with the potential for the planned renovation work to disturb the ACM.</p>

        <h4><em>Assessment of Asbestos-Containing Building Materials</em></h4>
        <p>Accessibility, Condition and Action (Priority) ratings for individual items, or defined areas were developed by Safetech to determine remedial action plans specific to the facility’s needs.</p>
        <h4><em>Condition</em></h4>
        <p>The condition of asbestos-containing materials identified in the subject area was assessed as Good (G), Fair (F) or Poor (P). The assessment criteria used to determine condition is dependent on material characteristics, such as friability. The following table summarizes the criteria used by Safetech to evaluate the condition of ACM.</p>

        <h4><em>Quantity</em></h4>
        <p>The approximate quantity and the units of measure related to the quantity (i.e.: linear feet (LF), square feet (SF) or each (EACH) as appropriate to the item) have only been provided for materials requiring remedial or corrective action (i.e. materials in Fair or Poor condition). In such circumstances any quantities provided should be considered rough estimates only and should not be solely relied upon for bidding purposes. <strong>It is the responsibility of the selected Contractor to obtain actual quantities</strong>.</p>

        <h4>Lead</h4>
        <p>If paint samples were collected, they were collected by scraping the paint down to the base material substrate to ensure collection of all layers of paint. Care would be taken to avoid collection of the underlying substrate to reduce analytical substrate matrix interference.</p>
        <p>If collected, paint samples were submitted to an independent laboratory for the determination of lead content. The laboratory would participate in and accredited by the EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) for analysis of lead in paint chips through the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Environmental Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (ELLAP). Analysis would be conducted by the laboratory following the EPA “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods” (SW-846), Method 7000B “Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry”. Result of analysis would be reported by the laboratory as the percentage of lead by weight of the total sample (% by wt.).</p>
        <p>The presence of lead in other materials, such as lead sheeting, pigmented mortar, lead piping, lead solder, etc. would be noted where observed but not sampled to verify lead content. Lead can be present in these materials to varying degrees, depending on their age of application and should be considered lead-containing until proven otherwise.</p>

        <h4>Mercury</h4>
        <p>The type, quantity and location of mercury-containing equipment and devices in the subject area were determined by visual inspection based on appearance, age and knowledge of historical uses. Sampling for mercury-containing building materials and dismantling of suspect mercury-containing equipment was not performed. Where possible, attempts were made to verify the presence/absence of mercury by gathering additional information such as equipment model number, serial number, etc.</p>

        <h4>Silica</h4>
        <p>The presence of crystalline silica in building materials was determined through visual inspection of building materials only, based on knowledge of the historic use of silica-containing materials in certain building materials. Sampling to verify the presence/absence of silica in building materials was not performed.</p>

        <h4>Other Designated Substances</h4>
        <p>Other designated substances (i.e. acrylonitrile, arsenic, benzene, coke oven emissions, ethylene oxide, isocyanates, and vinyl chloride) are typically not expected to be encountered in building materials as significant constituents or in a form that would represent an exposure concern. These substances were not included in the assessment unless specific information regarding their use (e.g. in a manufacturing process) was provided to us. No sampling for these designated substances was performed.</p>

        <h4>Other Hazardous Materials</h4>
        <h4><em>Chemical Hazards</em></h4>
        <p>A visual inspection to evaluate the possible presence of Urea Formaldehyde Foam Insulation (UFFI) was conducted in the subject area. Our visual inspection was limited to identifying evidence of possible UFFI installation (i.e. repaired nozzle holes in walls) and overspray at wall/ceiling joints, etc. No destructive testing or material sampling was conducted as part of the assessment.</p>

        <h4>Biological Hazards</h4>
        <h4><em>Mould Contamination</em></h4>
        <p>A visual inspection to determine the possibility of mould growth was conducted in the subject area. The assessment was limited to identifying evidence of mould growth and water damage (staining, material deterioration, efflorescence, etc.) on the surface of building materials, which may be an indicator of hidden mould growth. No moisture content readings of building materials were taken to determine their current condition. Additionally, destructive testing to confirm the presence/absence of hidden mould growth and material sampling to verify the presence/absence of mould on suspect surfaces was beyond the scope of this assessment.</p>
        <h4><em>Pest Infestation</em></h4>
        <p>The presence and extent of pest infestation in the subject area was based on visually inspecting for evidence of significant pest activity, including signs of nesting, droppings/fecal accumulation, dead insects/carcass accumulation, etc. Evidence of minor pest presence was not considered to be indicative of pest infestation.</p>

        <h4>Environmental Hazards</h4>
        <h4><em>Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)</em></h4>
        <p>The presence of PCB-containing electrical equipment in the subject area was identified through visual inspection and knowledge of the timeline of historical use.</p>
        <p>For stand-alone transformers and capacitors, information from the manufacturer nameplate (such as the date of manufacture, dielectric fluid trade name or “Type Number”, etc.) was gathered, where possible, to further evaluate if the equipment may contain PCBs. This information was then compared to the information provided in the Environment Canada document entitled “Handbook on PCB’s in Electrical Equipment” (Third Edition, April 1988) to aid in identification. Transformers and capacitors confirmed to be manufactured after 1979 were assumed to not contain PCBs. If appropriate information could not be obtained it was assumed that the transformer or capacitor contained PCBs.</p>
        <p>For fluorescent light ballasts, a representative number of fixtures were inspected, if possible, for assessment areas that were constructed prior to 1980 and where there was no history or evidence of a complete lighting retrofit. The light fixtures were examined by removing any lenses and ballast covers to expose the ballast and identify information such as ballast make, model number, serial number, and date code. This information was then compared to the information provided in the Environment Canada document entitled “Identification of Lamp Ballasts Containing PCBs” (Report EPS 2/CC/2 (revised) August 1991) to aid in identification. Ballasts that could not be confirmed Non-PCB-containing were assumed to contain PCBs. The light fixtures were not de-energized and ballasts were not removed to obtain manufacturer information that may be on the back of the ballast. If visual confirmation of ballast type could not be made it was assumed that light fixtures in areas constructed prior to 1980 that have not undergone a complete lighting retrofit have PCB-containing ballasts until proven otherwise.</p>
        <p>No sampling of materials or fluids within equipment was conducted to verify the presence/absence of PCBs. Inspection and testing of other materials for PCB content, including (but not limited to) caulking, asphalt, oil-based paint, plastics, switches, electric cables and hydraulic fluids was beyond the scope of the assessment.</p>
        <h4><em>Ozone Depleting and Global Warming Substances</em></h4>
        <p>The presence of fixed equipment likely to contain ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and/or global-warming substances (GWS) was identified through visual inspection and knowledge of the timeline of historical use. This included equipment such as chillers, air-conditioners, walk-in refrigeration and freezer units and fixed dry-chemical fire extinguishers, where chemicals such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) or halons may be present. Where possible, information regarding the type and quantity of refrigerant present was obtained from the manufacturer nameplate. Our visual assessment was limited to fixed equipment in the subject area and did not include portable equipment such as stand-alone refrigerators, freezers, water coolers, air-conditioners and fire extinguishers, etc.</p>
